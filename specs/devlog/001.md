# Devlog 001 - Hello World & Build Setup

**Date:** 2026-02-02

## What Changed
- Created `src/main.c` - includes stdio.h, prints "Hello"
- Created `makefile` with `build` and `run` targets, `.PHONY` declarations
- Compiling with strict flags: `-Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Werror`
- Output binary named `riichi`

## Concepts Learned
- C compilation pipeline: preprocessing → compilation → linking
- Linker needs `main` as entry point; empty file fails at link stage, not compile
- `int main(void)` is explicit; `int main()` means "unspecified args" (legacy quirk)
- C99 special rule: `main` implicitly returns 0 (only function with this magic)
- `#include` is preprocessor text substitution - pastes header contents
- Compiler warnings catch style issues; `-Werror` promotes them to errors
- Make compares timestamps: target vs dependencies
- `.PHONY` marks targets that don't produce same-named files

## Next Steps
- Explore `clang-tidy` / `cppcheck` for static analysis
- Represent a mahjong tile
