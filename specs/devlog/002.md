# Devlog 002 - Structs, Pointers, and Static Analysis

**Date:** 2026-02-05

## What Changed
- Added `cppcheck` target to makefile with `--enable=warning,style,performance,portability`
- Created `Tile` struct with `uint8_t` fields for suit and value
- Added `<stdint.h>` and `<stdlib.h>` includes
- Program allocates a Tile with `malloc`, sets `suit` field, and prints address, size, and suit value

## Concepts Learned
- **cppcheck vs clang-tidy**: Complementary tools — cppcheck for bug detection, clang-tidy for style/modernization
- **Struct definition**: `typedef struct { ... } Name;` avoids repeating `struct` keyword
- **Fixed-width types**: `uint8_t` from `<stdint.h>` gives exact 8-bit unsigned; `int` size varies by platform
- **Pointer operators**: `&` (address-of) and `*` (dereference) are opposites
- **`->` operator**: `ptr->field` is shorthand for `(*ptr).field`; exists because `.` has higher precedence than `*`
- **`*` dual meaning**: In declarations (`Tile *ptr`) it's part of the type; in expressions (`*ptr`) it dereferences
- **Format specifiers**: `%p` for pointers (cast to `void *`), `%zu` for `size_t`
- Tile struct is 2 bytes (two `uint8_t` fields) vs 8 bytes with two `int` fields

## Next Steps
- Understand stack vs heap allocation (started but deferred)
- Explore bit fields for tighter packing
- Free malloc'd memory (currently leaks on exit)
