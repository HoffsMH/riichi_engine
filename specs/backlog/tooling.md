# Backlog - Tooling

## Dynamic Analysis
- **Valgrind** — runtime memory error detection (leaks, use-after-free, uninitialised reads)
- **AddressSanitizer** (`-fsanitize=address`) — compiler-based memory error detection
- **LeakSanitizer** — focused on memory leak detection

## Coverage
- **gcov / lcov** — measure which lines of code are actually exercised by tests

## Debugging
- **gdb / lldb** — step through code, inspect variables, set breakpoints
